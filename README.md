# Claude Code Configuration Library

Welcome! This repository is my personal collection of pluggable configurations for Claude Code—custom commands, agents, hooks, Skills, and MCP servers that enhance my daily workflow.

## 🎯 Purpose

As I work across systems architecture, distributed systems, and software engineering, I've found that having the right tools configured for Claude Code dramatically improves productivity. This repository is where I accumulate and share configurations that have proven useful in my work.

## 🔧 My Tech Stack & Focus Areas

The configurations in this repository reflect my professional focus:

- **Systems Architecture**: Designing scalable, resilient systems
- **Distributed & Event-Driven Systems**: Building reactive, decoupled architectures
- **Go-Centric Development**: Primary language for building robust backend systems
- **Knowledge Access**: Tools and patterns for information retrieval and synthesis
- **Emergence**: Exploring emergent properties in both natural and engineered systems

## 📚 What You'll Find Here

This repository contains:

- **Custom Agents**: Specialized AI assistants for domain-specific tasks
- **MCP Servers**: Model Context Protocol servers for enhanced capabilities
- **Skills**: Reusable skill configurations for common workflows
- **Hooks**: Integration points for extending Claude Code behavior
- **Commands**: Custom commands for streamlined operations

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) installed and configured
- Familiarity with the Claude Code plugin system

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/notorious-ai/claude-plugins.git
   cd claude-plugins
   ```

2. Browse the configurations in their respective directories

3. Follow the individual configuration READMEs for specific setup instructions

## 🤝 Contributing

While this is primarily a personal repository, I welcome:

- **Suggestions**: Ideas for improvements or new configurations
- **Bug Reports**: If something doesn't work as expected
- **Discussions**: Thoughts on distributed systems, Go patterns, or emergence

Feel free to open an issue to start a conversation!

## 📖 Usage Philosophy

These configurations are designed with several principles in mind:

1. **Composability**: Each configuration should work independently and compose well with others
2. **Clarity**: Clear documentation and examples for each configuration
3. **Pragmatism**: Solutions that work in real-world scenarios, not just theory
4. **Evolution**: Configurations evolve as I learn and discover better patterns

## 📝 License

This repository is provided as-is for educational and reference purposes. Individual configurations may have their own licensing requirements—check the specific directories for details.

## 🌱 About Emergence

The concept of emergence—where complex patterns arise from simple rules—fascinates me in both natural systems and software architecture. You'll find this philosophy reflected in how these configurations are designed: simple, composable pieces that enable sophisticated workflows.
