## TL;DR
<instructions>
Write a SUCCINCT TL;DR-style paragraph of the video's content. Careful to NOT repeat the video's description. Focus on the value I get as a viewer.

Follow with a "Watch again when..." sentence in its own paragraph, focusing on situations in my life/career where this video would be valuable.

Think hard on this section.

## Video Description
<instructions>
Some videos have good descriptions, other contain a lot of spam. When the description is good, you may copy it verbatim. Otherwise, clip useful snippets from it, and fill the rest from the transcript.
DO NOT include promotions, advertisements, spammy links, weirdly formatted paragraphs, thank yous, credits, or donations.
DO NOT recap the entire video, extract just enough information out so that I will be reminded about this video's value for me or friends as viewers.

Think harder on this section.

## Personal Takeaways
<instructions>
This section is going to be tough for you to accomplish because it requires knowledge about me. Look around at other video files in this folder to understand me and my takeaways. You may write as if you're speaking directly to me, suggesting and highlighting pieces you find important for me to notice.
</instructions>

## Links & Concepts
<instructions>
- First of all, YouTube videos should backlink to [[YouTube]].
- Backlinks to pages in the Concept folder, if any are relevant. Look at the `Concept/` folder for the complete list of existing concepts.
- Backlink to related talks/resources, if any are relevant.
- Links to online resources, wikis, blogs, etc, if any.
- Optionally repeat backlinks from the above content.

Format as a list.
