## TL;DR
<instructions>
Write a BRIEF, punchy paragraph (2-3 sentences max) that speaks directly to me as a viewer about WHY I should watch this. Focus on the compelling hook, key insight, or unique value proposition—not a summary of what's covered.

Follow with a single "Watch again when..." sentence in its own paragraph, focusing on situations in my life/career where this video would be valuable.

Keep this section SHORT and reader-focused. Think hard on this section.
</instructions>

## Video Description
<instructions>
Start with the original YouTube description if it's good (clean and informative). If it's good but short, add a "Highlights" subsection with key points from the transcript.

If the YouTube description is spammy, reconstruct it from the transcript. Prioritize the main topics, arguments, and notable examples—create an index of what's covered so I can decide whether to watch and what to look for.

DO NOT include promotions, advertisements, spammy links, weirdly formatted paragraphs, thank yous, credits, or donations.
DO NOT recap the entire video—this should help me navigate the content, not replace watching it.

Think harder on this section.

## Personal Takeaways
<instructions>
This section is going to be tough for you to accomplish because it requires knowledge about me. Look around at other video files in this folder to understand me and my takeaways. You may write as if you're speaking directly to me, suggesting and highlighting pieces you find important for me to notice.
</instructions>

## Links & Concepts
<instructions>
- First of all, YouTube videos should backlink to [[YouTube]].
- Backlinks to pages in the Concept folder, if any are relevant. Look at the `Concept/` folder for the complete list of existing concepts.
- Backlink to related talks/resources, if any are relevant.
- Links to online resources, wikis, blogs, etc, if any.
- Optionally repeat backlinks from the above content.

Format as a list.
