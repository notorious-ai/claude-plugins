# Custom Agents

This directory contains specialized agent configurations for domain-specific tasks.

## What are Custom Agents?

Custom agents in Claude Code are specialized AI assistants that can be configured with specific instructions, tools, and knowledge to excel at particular tasks within your workflow.

## Future Additions

As I develop and refine agents for:
- Go code review and optimization
- Distributed systems architecture analysis
- Event-driven system design
- System resilience patterns
- Knowledge synthesis and documentation

...they'll be added here with their respective configurations and usage instructions.
