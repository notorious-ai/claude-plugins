# Custom Commands

Custom command definitions for streamlined operations in Claude Code.

## What are Custom Commands?

Custom commands extend Claude Code with domain-specific operations tailored to your workflow. They can automate repetitive tasks, provide shortcuts for complex operations, or integrate with external tools.

## Planned Commands

Commands in this repository will focus on:
- **Go Development**: Testing, benchmarking, dependency management
- **System Operations**: Deployment, monitoring, debugging
- **Architecture Tools**: Diagram generation, dependency analysis
- **Documentation**: Auto-generation, validation, updates
- **Knowledge Tools**: Search, summarization, cross-referencing

## Command Structure

Each command will include:
```
command-name/
├── command.yaml        # Command definition
├── README.md          # Usage documentation
├── src/               # Command implementation (if applicable)
└── examples/          # Usage examples
```

---

*Commands will be added as workflow efficiencies are identified.*
