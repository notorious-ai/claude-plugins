# Skills

Reusable skill configurations that define common workflows and capabilities for Claude Code.

## What are Skills?

Skills in Claude Code are predefined capabilities that can be composed together to create powerful workflows. They encapsulate best practices and patterns for specific types of tasks.

## Focus Areas

Skills in this repository will focus on:
- **Go Development**: Idiomatic patterns, error handling, concurrency
- **System Design**: Architecture patterns, scalability considerations
- **Event-Driven Systems**: Message handling, event sourcing, CQRS
- **Distributed Systems**: Consensus, consistency, fault tolerance
- **Knowledge Management**: Documentation, learning, synthesis

## Structure

Each skill will typically include:
```
skill-name/
├── skill.yaml           # Skill definition
├── README.md           # Documentation and examples
├── examples/           # Example usage scenarios
└── templates/          # Code templates (if applicable)
```

---

*Skills will be added as reusable patterns emerge.*
